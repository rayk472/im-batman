### Bio

```markdown
As a corrections officer in the Pacific Northwest, Kelin Ray was responsible for tracking down fugitives and keeping the peace. 
He was also a member of the Inmate Recovery Team, which meant he often had to deal with disruptive or violent inmates. 
However, after serving in Iraq as a gunner for convoy security operations, Kelin decided to leave his corrections officer job and pursue a new career in coding. 
He's currently learning to code and is hoping to use his new skills to build websites or apps that can make a difference in people's lives. 
In the meantime, he's spending his free time cosplaying as Batman.
